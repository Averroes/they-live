THEY LIVE
=========
Steganographic Decryption, of sorts
-----------------------------------

A Chrome browser extension that, eventually, will 
decrypt all images on a web page that are encrypted 
in a very particular (and trivial) way.

This project is just-for-fun, mostly to look deeper
into image manipulation using Javascript and the 
HTML5 canvas element.

Thanks to Ben Mullins's "Burning Man Enhancer" Chrome extension
for getting this started.
